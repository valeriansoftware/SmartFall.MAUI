# 📱 SmartFall – Funny Sounds on Impact  

**SmartFall** is a fun mobile app that detects when your phone falls and plays hilarious sounds upon impact!   

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Custom Sounds** – Choose from a variety of funny sound effects or upload your own.  
✅ **Works in Background** – The app runs even when minimized, ensuring you never miss a moment.  
✅ **Optimized Detection** – Uses accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to distinguish real falls from random movements.  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. **Detects Free Fall** – When the phone accelerates below a threshold (simulating free fall).  
2. **Detects Impact** – A sudden spike in acceleration confirms the phone has hit a surface.  
3. **Plays Sound** – A funny sound effect is triggered immediately upon impact.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/valeriansoftware/SmartFall.MAUI.Android.git
