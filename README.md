📱 SmartFall – Funny Sounds on Impact
SmartFall is a fun mobile app that detects when your phone falls and plays hilarious sounds upon impact!

🎯 Features
✅ Custom Sounds – Choose from a variety of funny sound effects or upload your own.
✅ Works in Background – The app runs even when minimized, ensuring you never miss a moment.
✅ Optimized Detection – Uses accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to distinguish real falls from random movements.

🛠️ How It Works
Detects Free Fall – When the phone accelerates below a threshold (simulating free fall).

Detects Impact – A sudden spike in acceleration confirms the phone has hit a surface.

Plays Sound – A funny sound effect is triggered immediately upon impact.
